						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">INTRODUCTION</p>
							<p class="darkGrayText_1">Alchemon is the next step in the evolving “Play to Earn” model. Alchemon is the first monster-collecting NFT staking, crafting and trading card game only on the Algorand Blockchain. Get your Alchemon, evolve them and then craft Epic and Legendary Alchemon. Interacting with the project earns you AlcheCoin, evolutions, prizes, and more.
							<br><br>Alchemon is a deflationary NFT Card game. This means when you evolve your Alchemon you earn a brand-new, stronger Alchemon. But the lower level versions of them get redistributed back into the Crafting and Staking Wallets so others can then evolve theirs as well. When crafting an Epic or Legendary, you will be combining and losing the Alchemon for the new powerful Alchemon.</p>
						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">MISSION</p>
							<p class="darkGrayText_1">Alchemon intends to be the first Play to Earn game on the Algorand blockchain by creating engaging NFTs and an excellent gaming experience all while handing the economics over to the community.</p>
						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">PROBLEM</p>	
							<p class="darkGrayText_1">While NFTs on Algorand are exploding in popularity, there is not much use for them besides holding them in your wallet or reselling them for profit. This project was started to make high quality NFTs with a use! NFTs have so many more real world uses, including gaming!
							<br><br>Also, the gaming industry is changing as well. With crypto it is possible to create a full “Play to Earn” economy. This shift will end microtransactions and squeezing every dollar out of the players in the existing gaming landscape.
							<br><br>We want to bring high quality NFT gaming to the Algorand blockchain. As far as we are concerned, Algorand is the only existing blockchain that works in every way, including: Security, Scalability, and Low Fees.</p>
						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">SOLUTION</p>	
							<p class="darkGrayText_1">We intend to be a grassroots version of Axie Infinity on the Algorand blockchain. This will be the first “Play to Earn” game on Algorand. We are building our game up, with the community, by selling affordable NFT Cards to anyone who can then interact with the Alchemon project and earn AlcheCoin. This gives gamers opportunity to get in at the ground floor & removes the barriers to entry that you will see in games like Axie Infinity. We also allow free and interactive ways to evolve, inexpensive ways to craft as well as free ways to earn more Alchemon.
							<br><br>With the sale of these Alchemon we are pushing forward and making a great game that people will want to play without the huge cost of entry. Right now players can get NFT Cards and stake them in their own wallet to earn AlcheCoin. Also players can stake their Alchemon in the Training Grounds to evolve for free, trade in and craft to get stronger Alchemon & stake in the Hunting Grounds to get tickets for a weekly raffle!</p>
						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">TOKEN: ALCHECOIN</p>
							<p class="darkGrayText_1">We have not priced/sold AlcheCoin. We leave it to the community to earn AlcheCoin and build worth into it. Our job is to create a great game for the community to play and always have a new stream of users who want to “Play to Earn.” This, in turn, is the exchange for the community to want to trade and give value to AlcheCoin and an increased value to Alchemon NFT Cards. Therefore anyone having AlcheCoin will be in a position to sell it to newer players, increasing the price and adding value to the whole ecosystem.</p>
						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">GAMEPLAY</p>
							<p class="darkGrayText_1">We are building this up to be a grassroots game where the community is an integral part of the ecosystem. Ideally we will make a AAA comparable game, but will keep building slowly with the community as necessary.
							<br><br>We are starting with a 3v3 battling system to earn more AlcheCoin than just by staking alone. We intend to bring other game modes as well. We will have ways to level and evolve your Alchemon in game. This will be in addition to the existing staking and trading methods that currently exist.
							<br><br>Along with the NFT Cards themselves, we will be creating special attacks and possibly abilities/armor that can be equipped by your Alchemon in-game. Each Alchemon will have their standard attacks and stats, but can be improved by owning other ASAs making your top team completely customizable.
							<br><br>Alchemon NFT Cards & AlcheCoin will be used to play the game. Players will need both and have interacted with the project before playing. While this may seem like a big barrier, keep in mind it costs about $1000 USD to get going in Axie Infinity.</p>
						<p class="orangeHeader" id="spreadText">VISION</p>
							<p class="darkGrayText_1" id="marginFix_2">There is an infinity of options of where to take the game. In the future we plan to compete with the status quo of mobile gaming and even AAA gaming as well. We aim to grow WITH the community we build, not against it. Players are not seen as income sources, they are the driving force for the ecosystem to become more valuable for the whole game economy. We have options to make this a truly decentralized game, with AlcheCoin being a governance token. Tough balancing decisions or new attacks/abilities could be decided by the AlcheCoin holders even before being fully decentralized. Axie Infinity cannot be truly decentralized as they use their own blockchain, maintained by their company. Only Algorand can host a truly decentralized blockchain game due to the points listed above.</p>
